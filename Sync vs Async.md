*When multiple threads are working on the same data, and the value of our data is changing, that scenario is not thread-safe and we will get inconsistent results. When a thread is already working on an object and preventing another thread on working on the same object, this process is called Thread-Safety.*

*Synchronous are thread safe and Asynchronous are not thread safe*
